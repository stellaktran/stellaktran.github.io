Not too long ago, I kept a blog, and like many self-centered teenagers, wrote a lot about nothing. Thankfully for my self-esteem, a few friends and my mother humored me. Despite how much I loved writing, I did it sparingly when I stopped publicly airing my self-pity (ha, please continue to humor me).

I recently re-discovered the magic of writing. Some days, it&#8217;s a form of meditation. Other days, it&#8217;s to get things down and out of my brain. In the best way, it&#8217;s my tool to think out loud, to process my jumbled thoughts about our increasingly complex, confusing world, and my role in it as global citizen.

I find myself thinking about stuff at the intersection of innovation, capital markets, governance & civil society, and a few questions I&#8217;m tracking via this blog (among others):

  * What does an inclusive world look like, and what do we design to get there? (related: [I explore a case for a world without borders](https://stellaktran.com/blog/whats-our-responsibility/))
  * How will technology affect disenfranchised communities? Specifically frontier technology? How might frontier technology be used to reduce inequality? (related: [incorporating informal economy dynamics in our designs of new systems](https://stellaktran.com/blog/informal-economy/))
  * How could we fundamentally change incentives structures via finance and business model innovation?

Also, personal questions such as:

  * How do I organize my life? (related: my post on [meditation](https://stellaktran.com/blog/eat-your-vegetables/))
  * How do values show up in our lives? How do we hold them in moments of tension, when they most test us? (related: [the tensions of feeling and having power](https://stellaktran.com/blog/experiencing-power/))
  * What are examples of extraordinary moral leadership?
  * How do I improve my decision making as an investor? (related: [how should I think about hidden costs?](https://stellaktran.com/blog/looking-for-hidden-costs/))
  * How can I ask better questions?

Things you might expect to see here:

  * Notes from a book I&#8217;m reading
  * Articles, podcasts, or other media that I&#8217;ve enjoyed or found particularly powerful
  * An occasional playlist (the only thing I&#8217;m really good at)
