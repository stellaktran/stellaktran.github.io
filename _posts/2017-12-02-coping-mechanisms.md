Hey, world!

It&#8217;s my first blog.

To celebrate, I&#8217;d like to share my favorite (possibly counterfeit) comic from Calvin and Hobbes. I revisit this comic every time I have a panic attack about sharing too much of my data and contributing to the inevitable AI takeover. (All this said as I purr sweet nothings into my Google Home.)

What are _you_ doing? Why are you reading this? _Go play already_.
