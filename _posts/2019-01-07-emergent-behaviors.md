I enjoyed this wide ranging conversation between [Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, and Tyler Cowen](https://soundcloud.com/a16z/talent-tech-trends-culture-ben-marc-tyler-cowen-summit-2018), which covers their partnership, how Marc and Ben thought about a16z&#8217;s differentiation when they founded the firm, how VC has evolved, and what&#8217;s next for [insert your favorite tech or industry here]. There&#8217;s several gems in this episode (which somebody painstakingly captured on [Breaker](https://www.breaker.audio/a16z/e/41740643)) and worth a full listen. Here&#8217;s one that I found particularly useful&#8230;

From Marc, in response to Tyler&#8217;s question, &#8220;Did you invent the tweet storm?&#8221;:

> &#8220;I literally couldn&#8217;t shut up, so it sort of catalyzed. The big lesson for these internet platforms is [&#8230;] **emergent behaviors is incredibly important. The really successful platforms let users surface the behaviors that the creators of the platform could have never thought of.** Twitter has had issues over the years, but [&#8230;] the compelling ways people have used Twitter have been invented by users. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s not just Twitter. It was true of the personal computer. It was true of smart phones. It&#8217;s been true for many of these Internet platforms. It&#8217;s a useful principle for product design: let the users innovate.&#8221;

Emergent behavior extends far beyond product, and is a useful principle across a number of domains. For me, top of mind are community building, advocacy and organizing, but I do wonder how one tracks and responds to these interactions in an offline environment. Y<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ou&#8217;re operating in an environment wherein the data isn&#8217;t (1) readily available, and (2) as responsive, so how do you know when that behavior is indicative of a larger group behavior? What is real and what is noise?Â If you want to co-create with your community, how do you set up a response system for that kind of interaction?</span>

In any case, as a person that&#8217;s constantly holding everything in her head, planning everything from A to Z, I appreciate the reminder to let go, enjoy the magic of improvisation, and make it up as I go along (with co-conspirators, if possible).

(P.S. I just realized that my blogs ask a lot of questions but rarely suggests a hypothesis or attempts to find the answer. I&#8217;m going to try to do that more in 2019.)
