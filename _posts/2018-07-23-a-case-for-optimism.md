  <strong>What I read this weekend: </strong>I feel such heaviness from the vicious cycle of bad news and bad forecasts, from immigration policy, deteriorating social safety net and world order to climate change and automation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wycjnCCgUes">It feels like we&#8217;re only going backward</a>. And some days, this weight compounds because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/opinion/climate-change-parenting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/opinion/climate-change-parenting.html&source=gmail&ust=1533806907569000&usg=AFQjCNHaVxglE8m4dEJdAShit65N4RJhmw">these problems feel insurmountable</a>. This <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/bad-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/bad-news&source=gmail&ust=1533806907569000&usg=AFQjCNGVXTnQYVkE7cdshajZwhH2_orSBg">Shouts & Murmurs piece</a> does a great job of capturing the manic hum of doom and gloom.<br class="m_6729121993356532639gmail-kix-line-break" /><br class="m_6729121993356532639gmail-kix-line-break" />I found <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/are-things-getting-better-or-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/are-things-getting-better-or-worse&source=gmail&ust=1533806907569000&usg=AFQjCNEZb_no9ndyW_VmIJwlDtw--TBHZQ">this hopeful article</a> that makes a case for progress, and in turn, optimism. The author cites Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now book and a few other notable thinkers on this topic, and an observation that really stuck with me is that this pessimism could ultimately affect the policies we choose to support and how we vote. I also listened to <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/vitalik-buterin-tyler-cowen-cryptocurrency-blockchain-tech-3a2b20c12c97" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/vitalik-buterin-tyler-cowen-cryptocurrency-blockchain-tech-3a2b20c12c97&source=gmail&ust=1533806907569000&usg=AFQjCNFwPigZUG4B612Nz7Z2KwePuswCFg">an interview with Vitalik Buterin (the founder of Ethereum)</a>, who believes that the most popular delusion or irrationality should be our belief in progress. I&#8217;m now thinking of ways to actively flip these negative scripts in my head, and to find scripts for hope, optimism, and progress even in trying times. I shared this reflection with my team and some friends, who shared their own awesome life hacks:

  Don&#8217;t get caught up in the minutia of day-to-day news. It&#8217;s OK not to hear every update. Know the key themes.

Also, see Outlier&#8217;s <a href="https://outlier.ai/2017/04/10/data-storytelling/">series on data storytelling</a>, where the team explores how data can mislead you.

So: what does give me hope? People that show up, as much as they can, like these wonderful humans that came together for the Families Together demonstration. We walked from Dolores Park to Civic Center to protest immigration policy in solidarity with our neighbors.
