Huh. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already March. If this is any indication of how the rest of the year will unfold&#8230;

In any case, here&#8217;s a playlist I made that dampens any unease I feel as I stare into the abyss of 2018. It has some sludgey lo-fi, opera, new age chill meets electronica banger, a delicate Trịnh Công Sơn track sung by Khánh Ly, that still feels fresh off vinyl—all inspired by Sufjan Steven&#8217;s [devastatingly beautiful score for Call Me By Your Name.](https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/sufjan-stevens-shares-stirring-score-for-coming-of-age-drama-call-me-by-your-name-stream-download/)

Vulture did a fun profile of [Sufjan Steven and his collaboration with director Luca Guadagnino](http://<a href=), which included several golden nuggets on their creative process.

To share two that stuck with me&#8230;

The magic of sharing sensibilities, or sharing how you intimately process and communicate the various textures of being alive:

> “Luca’s a real sensualist, and I very quickly keyed into that because I am, as well [&#8230;] There’s a physicality to his work that’s really profound, and there’s an emotional experience that’s occurring as well, and they have this divine interaction. So that’s really what I was working on, this idea of first love being really irrational and sensational, and feeling boundless in its experience.”

And the state of flow behind the magic:

> “I firmly believe in the power of impulse and instinct, and the ideology of ‘first thought, best thought,’ [&#8230;] I have to admit that often when I’m writing music, I’m sort of at a loss for how it all transpires. It feels so immediate and impulsive that I feel like I’m almost not in control. I’m not writing in a state of ecstasy, per se, but I feel almost powerless to the creative motion.”

Hope you&#8217;ll take a chance on the playlist, and may you find flow, people, and work that speak to your consciousness.

(Also, I make a lot of these things. [Follow me on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/122333622?si=iPHqI3zMR1K6gp2vduOV3w)!)
