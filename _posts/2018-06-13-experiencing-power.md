I just spent an eye-opening ten days in Vietnam, filled with overwhelming amounts of food, tropical fruit, and great conversation.

I went in _knowing_ that Vietnam was one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  And Vietnam&#8217;s middle and upper class were enjoying everyday evidence of this, from pizza to craft beer, while new skyscraper developments scattered across Saigon&#8217;s skyline. I also knew the other side of the story: one party rule, corruption, repression, and inequality.

_But knowing is not as powerful as seeing_, and I found myself startled by the poignant signs of unequal growth. Through out the entire trip, this feeling gnawed at me, and I struggled to articulate the current that ran through my reflections.

I found my first clue to make sense of this tension in re-reading Barack Obama&#8217;s extraordinary _Dreams from My Father_. He writes of his Indonesian stepfather&#8217;s sudden change in disposition when the family moved to Indonesia (bolded emphasis my own):

> _&#8220;Power. _The word fixed in my mother&#8217;s mind like a curse. **In America, it had generally remained hidden from view until you dug beneath the surface of things**; until you visited an Indian reservation or spoke to a black person whose trust you had earned. **But here power was undisguised, indiscriminate, naked, always fresh in memory.** Power had taken Lolo and yanked him back in line just when he thought he&#8217;d escape, **making him feel its weight, letting him know that his life wasn&#8217;t his own**. That&#8217;s how things were; you couldn&#8217;t change it, you could just live by the rules, so simple once you learned them. And so Lolo had made his peace with power, learned the wisdom of forgetting&#8230;&#8221;

I&#8217;m flooded with reactions, but I&#8217;ll let this clue (and the others I&#8217;m finding) marinate for now and report back. Hold me accountable to it.
